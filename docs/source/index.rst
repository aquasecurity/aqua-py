Welcome to Aqua-py
==================

A fantastic Python 3 client for Aqua's Container Security Platform.

| This project is an early stage effort and has a status of experimental.
| Questions, Comments, Feedback, Missing Calls, etc. Drop me a line @ jeff.thorne@aquasec.com


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: python

   pip install aqua

|
| Note: Requires Python 3.6 or higher due to reliance on Python's typing module and f strings.
|


Getting Started
---------------
Start by creating an Aqua object. This object represents the Aqua CSP API endpoint

.. code-block:: python

   from aqua import Aqua

   aqua = Aqua(id='administrator', password='password', host='mylo.uw.edu')

| Note: At this time there is no need to specify API version. The SDK does this on your behalf.
|
|

Example Usage
--------------
Please refer to the Endpoint api doc at :doc:`aqua.aqua` for current sdk api endpoint capabilities.
